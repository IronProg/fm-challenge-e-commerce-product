## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Modules
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I've learned how to use 'absolute' position CSS property along with a parent with 'relative' position to manipulate elements in the document, also learned a lot of TailwindCSS's workflow.

### Continued development

I'm still feeling a bit lost when manipulating image styles, so that's where I'll be focusing from now on.
